# Library Project
This is a small app I built from The Odin Project curriculum that allows the user to catalog the books they have read.
The goal of this project was to become familiar with object constructors and how to properly use them within your code.
#
The user is able to add books with title, author, page number & read status fields with the option to delete the book if needed.
